Yunokit is a plugin suite of out-of-the-box features for Supabase apps.

- **yunocontent**: Content Management System
- **yunocommunity**: Forums

Yunokit works by connecting directly to your Supabase projects and installing plugins on custom schemas on your database. Each custom schema has a full data API, allowing one-click addition of features to your apps. Manage micro-apps through the Yunokit admin panel at [app.yunokit.com](https://app.yunokit.com).

Yunokit is like PostgreSQL extensions, but for full fledge app features.
