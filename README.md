Yunokit is a suite of micro-apps for Supabase apps.

- **yunocontent**: Content Management System

Yunokit works by connecting directly to your Supabase projects and installing micro-apps on custom schemas on your database. Each custom schema has a full data API, allowing one-click addition of features to your apps. Manage micro-apps through the Yunokit admin panel at [app.yunokit.com](https://app.yunokit.com), with no need to build custom admin interfaces.

Yunokit is like PostgreSQL extensions, but for full fledge app features.
