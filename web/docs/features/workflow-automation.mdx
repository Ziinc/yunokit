# Yunoflow

Yunoflow adds workflow automation to your projects. It installs a dedicated `yunoflow` schema containing tables for workflows, runs and queues.

- Define tasks and dependencies using the DAG editor built with React Flow
- Queue workflows for execution or trigger them by calling `run_workflow(uuid)`
- Track run status and history

## Creating a workflow

1. Select **Workflows > Create** from the sidebar.
2. Drag task nodes into the canvas and connect them to express dependencies.
3. Nodes support JavaScript execution, notifications, API calls and database actions.
4. Click **Save** to store the graph.

## Running workflows

- Schedule jobs with cron expressions or invoke the `run_workflow` function from your code or database triggers.
- Runs appear in the workflow history with timestamps and status updates.
