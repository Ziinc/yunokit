# Supabase Integration

Supacontent integrates seamlessly with [Supabase](https://supabase.com) to provide a robust backend for your content management needs. This integration enables authentication, database storage, and real-time features.

## Connecting to Supabase

To use Supacontent, you'll need to connect it to a Supabase project. Here's how:

1. Navigate to the **Settings > Supabase** section in your Supacontent workspace
2. Click the "Connect Supabase Project" button
3. You'll be redirected to Supabase to authorize the connection
4. Select the project you want to connect to
5. Confirm the authorization

Once connected, Supacontent will automatically:
- Set up necessary database tables and schemas
- Configure row-level security policies
- Enable real-time subscriptions
- Set up storage buckets for media

## Managing Your Connection

You can manage your Supabase connection from the Settings page:

- View your current connection status
- Disconnect from a project if needed
- Monitor connection health

### Disconnecting a Project

When you disconnect a project:
- Your Supabase project remains intact
- No data is deleted from your Supabase database
- The Supacontent workspace becomes unusable until you connect a new project
- You'll need to reconnect a project to resume using Supacontent

## Security

The Supabase integration uses OAuth2 for secure authorization:
- No sensitive credentials are stored in your browser
- Connection tokens are securely managed
- Row-level security ensures data access control
- All communication is encrypted

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Supabase connection:

1. Check your project's status in the Supabase dashboard
2. Ensure your project's region is accessible
3. Try disconnecting and reconnecting
4. Contact support if issues persist
