# Supabase Integration

YunoContent integrates seamlessly with [Supabase](https://supabase.com) to provide a robust backend for your content management needs. This integration enables authentication, database storage, and real-time features.

## Connecting to Supabase

To connect your Supabase project to YunoContent:

1. Navigate to the **Settings > Supabase** page in your YunoContent workspace
2. Click the "Connect Supabase Project" button
3. You'll be redirected to Supabase to authorize the connection
4. Select the project you want to connect
5. Confirm the authorization

### What Happens During Connection

When you connect YunoContent to Supabase:
- Necessary database tables and schemas are automatically set up
- Row-level security policies are configured
- Real-time subscriptions are enabled
- Storage buckets for media are created
- Access tokens are securely stored for maintaining the connection
- Your project's schema information is retrieved to enable content management

## Managing Your Connection

You can manage your Supabase connection from the Settings page:

- View your current connection status and project details (name, ID, region)
- Disconnect your Supabase account
- Remove project association from a workspace
- Monitor connection health

### Disconnecting Your Supabase Account

When you disconnect your Supabase account:
- The supabase_connection record for your account is permanently deleted
- All access and refresh tokens used to connect to your Supabase account are removed
- This affects all workspaces associated with your account
- You'll need to reconnect your account to resume using YunoContent with Supabase

To disconnect:
1. Go to **Settings > Supabase**
2. Click "Disconnect Account"
3. Confirm the disconnection in the dialog that appears

### Removing Project Association

You can remove a project's association with your workspace without disconnecting your entire Supabase account:

- This nullifies the project_ref field for your workspace
- This is non-destructive and all data is still retained on the project
- No data will be shown in the workspace dashboard until a new project is linked
- Only affects the current workspace, not your Supabase account access

To remove a project association:
1. Go to **Settings > Supabase**
2. Click "Remove Project Association"
3. Type "delete" to confirm
4. Confirm the removal

## Querying Content with Supabase

You can query the created content using `supabase-js` for custom integration into your app.

Example `supabase-js` usage:

```js
const { data, error } = await client
  .from("content_items")
  .select()
  .eq("id", 1);
```

## Security

The Supabase integration uses OAuth2 for secure authorization:
- No sensitive credentials are stored in your browser
- Connection tokens are securely managed
- Row-level security ensures data access control
- All communication is encrypted

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Supabase connection:

1. Check your project's status in the Supabase dashboard
2. Ensure your project's region is accessible
3. Verify that the access tokens haven't expired (indicated by a "Token expired" status)
4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your account if problems persist
5. Ensure your Supabase project has the necessary database schema and permissions
6. Contact support if issues persist
