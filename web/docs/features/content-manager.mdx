### Client Querying

You can query the created content using `supabase-js` for custom integration into your app.

1. Select the published content item
2. Click "Unpublish" in the top right
3. The item will return to draft status

## Downloading Content

You can export your content for backup or migration purposes:

### Bulk Download

4. Choose your preferred format (JSON/CSV)
