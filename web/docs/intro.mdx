# Welcome to YunoContent

YunoContent is a modern headless CMS built on top of Supabase, designed to provide a flexible and powerful content management solution for developers and content teams.

Yunokit installs **micro-apps** on dedicated schemas of your Supabase project. Each micro-app ships with its own API so you can plug in features like content management with a single click. Think of these micro-apps as PostgreSQL extensions for complete functionality you manage from the Yunokit dashboard.
