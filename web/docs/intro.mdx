Yunokit is a plugin system with a batteries-included admin dashboard. Each plugin integrates seamlessly into existing Supabase stack, and can be used in isolation or together with other plugins.

### Plugin System

Yunokit connects to your Supabase projects and installs each plugin on a dedicated schema. Each schema exposes a full data API, letting you add features with a single click. Each plugin can then be managed within the Yunokit admin panel without needing to build a custom interfaces.

### Why?

**Admin dashboard**. Built-in admin dashboard for managing content, assets, and more.

**Integrate into existing Supabase projects**. Existing features and apps can directly query and join on data through the same familiar Supabase client.

**Stop re-inventing the wheel for each new project**. Focus on the value-added feature building, instead of re-creating boilerplate functionality.

**Migrations are automatically handled**. Spend your development hours on your UI instead of database schema building.

### The Yunokit App

The Yunokit admin panel is a dashboard that allows management of the plugins installed on each Supabase project workspace. It performs administrative actions at the `service_role` level.
