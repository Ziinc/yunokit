# Content Schema Builder

The Schema Builder allows you to define the structure of your content. There are two main types of schemas: Singles and Collections.

## Schema Types

### Singles

Single schemas represent standalone content that only has one instance. Examples include:

- Homepage
- About Page
- Privacy Policy
- Global Settings

Single schemas are ideal for unique content that doesn't need multiple entries.

### Collections

Collection schemas represent content types that can have multiple entries. Examples include:

- Blog Posts
- Products
- Team Members
- FAQ Items

Collections are perfect for content that follows the same structure but needs multiple entries.

## Schema Archiving

Schemas can be archived to prevent new content from being created. Archived schemas are still accessible and can be used to phase out deprecated content types.

**Active** schemas are in their default state where content can be created, edited, and published normally. 

**Archived** schemas prevent new content creation while keeping existing content accessible but marked as archived. Archived schemas are hidden from content creation forms and appear either in a dedicated "Archived" tab or with reduced opacity in the "All" view. This archiving system is useful for phasing out deprecated content types while maintaining access to historical content.

## Fields
