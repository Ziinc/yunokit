# YunoCommunity

YunoCommunity handles forums, posts, comments and user moderation. It uses the `yunocommunity` schema.

Schema: `yunocommunity`


## Posts and Comments

Each forum contains many posts. Posts support `multi_thread` mode allowing a Reddit style tree of comments, or single-thread mode for classic linear discussions.

Comments reference optional `parent_comment_id` to build the hierarchy.
