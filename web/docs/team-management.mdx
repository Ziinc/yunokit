# Team Management

## Role-Based Access Control

YunoContent implements a role-based access control (RBAC) system with four primary roles:

### Role Hierarchy

1. **Admin**
   - Full system access
   - Manage team members and roles
   - Configure system settings
   - Access all content operations

2. **Developer**
   - API and integration access
   - Content type management
   - Workflow configuration
   - Technical implementation

3. **Editor**
   - Plugin-level management and editing
   - Able to perform all editing actions on each plugin resource

4. **Viewer**
   - Basic read-only operations
   - No editing of plugin resources

### Team Management Features

## System Authors

### Content Types

Content types define the structure of content within YunoContent. Each content type:

- Has a unique identifier
- Contains a schema definition
- Supports validation rules
- Can have custom workflows

### Workflows

Workflows control the content lifecycle:

- Draft → Review → Published states
- Configurable approval steps
- Automated validation checks
- Custom state transitions

## Best Practices

1. Define clear content models
2. Implement proper validation
3. Use workflow hooks for automation
4. Follow API rate limits
5. Cache responses appropriately

## Security Considerations

- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication
- Follow least privilege principle
- Validate all inputs
- Rate limit API requests
