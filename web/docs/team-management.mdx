## System Authors

### Content Types

Content types define the structure of content within Supacontent. Each content type:

- Has a unique identifier
- Contains a schema definition
- Supports validation rules
- Can have custom workflows

### Workflows

Workflows control the content lifecycle:

- Draft → Review → Published states
- Configurable approval steps
- Automated validation checks
- Custom state transitions

## Best Practices

1. Define clear content models
2. Implement proper validation
3. Use workflow hooks for automation
4. Follow API rate limits
5. Cache responses appropriately

## Security Considerations

- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication
- Follow least privilege principle
- Validate all inputs
- Rate limit API requests
