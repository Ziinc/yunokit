# Supabase Integration

Yunokit connects to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as an OAuth2 application to provide a seamless integration with your Supabase project.

Each workspace links to an individual Supabase project.

 The Supabase connection or the Supabase project linkage can be removed at any time, while preserving all data on the target Supabase project.

## Service API Authentication

To authenticate with the data API, Yunokit stores the legacy `service_role` key for usage with the connected Supabase project.

## What does Yunokit do after connecting to a Supabase project?

When you connect Yunokit to Supabase:
- Necessary database tables and schemas are automatically set up via migrations
- Row-level security policies are configured
- Real-time subscriptions are enabled
- Storage buckets for media are created
- Access tokens are securely stored for maintaining the connection
- Your project's schema information is retrieved to enable content management


## Migration Management
Yunokit will perform migrations for all plugins. Each plugin tracks its own migraitons on its own schema. Due to the interconnected nature of the plugins, it is necessary for all plugins to be updated at the same time during a Database migration.

However, each individual migration script executed is scoped to a specific plugin and can be tracked on the plugin's `schema_migrations` table.

### Disconnecting Your Supabase Account

When you disconnect your Supabase account:
- The supabase_connection record for your account is permanently deleted
- All access and refresh tokens used to connect to your Supabase account are removed

This affects all connected workspaces, and you will need to reconnect your account to resume using Yunokit with Supabase.
