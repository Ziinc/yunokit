# Content Schema Builder

The Schema Builder allows you to define the structure of your content. There are two main types of schemas: Singles and Collections.

## Schema Types

### Singles

Single schemas represent standalone content that only has one instance. Examples include:

- Homepage
- About Page
- Privacy Policy
- Global Settings

Single schemas are ideal for unique content that doesn't need multiple entries.

### Collections

Collection schemas represent content types that can have multiple entries. Examples include:

- Blog Posts
- Products
- Team Members
- FAQ Items

Collections are perfect for content that follows the same structure but needs multiple entries.

## Schema Status

### Active vs Archived

- **Active**: Default state for schemas. Content can be created, edited, and published.
- **Archived**:
  - No new content can be created
  - Existing content remains accessible but marked as archived
  - Hidden from content creation forms
  - Visible in the "Archived" tab or with reduced opacity in "All" view
  - Can be used to phase out deprecated content types

### Archiving Schemas

You can archive schemas in two ways:

1. **Bulk Archive**: Select multiple schemas using the checkboxes and click the "Archive" action in the selection bar
2. **Individual Archive**: Use the "Manage Schema" button on a specific schema

Archiving is reversible and is recommended over deletion when:

- Deprecating content types that still have existing content
- Temporarily disabling content creation for specific types
- Maintaining content history while preventing new entries

## Field Types

The following field types are available when building your schema:

| Field Type  | Description                             |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `text`      | Multi-line text area for longer content |
| `markdown`  | Rich text editor with markdown support  |
| `reference` | Reference to other content items        |
| `boolean`   | True/false toggle                       |
| `number`    | Numeric input                           |
| `datetime`  | Date and time picker                    |
