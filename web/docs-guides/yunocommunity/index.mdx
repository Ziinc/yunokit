# YunoCommunity

YunoCommunity handles forums, posts, comments and user moderation. It runs in its own `yunocommunity` schema and exposes APIs via the community function. Use it to create forums, approve posts, ban users and configure community options.

## Features

- Forum management
- Post creation and moderation
- Comment threading (multi-thread or single-thread)
- User moderation and banning
- Content approval workflows

## Integration

Relevant tables:
- `yunocommunity.forums`
- `yunocommunity.posts`
- `yunocommunity.comments`

## Posts and Comments

Each forum contains many posts. Posts support `multi_thread` mode allowing a Reddit style tree of comments, or single-thread mode for classic linear discussions. Comments reference optional `parent_comment_id` to build the hierarchy.

## Quick Start

```ts
// List forums
const { data: forums } = await client
  .schema("yunocommunity")
  .from("forums")
  .select("*")
  .order("created_at", { ascending: false });

// Create a new post
const { data: post } = await client
  .schema("yunocommunity")
  .from("posts")
  .insert({
    forum_id: "<forum_id>",
    title: "Hello World",
    body: "First post content"
  })
  .select()
  .single();
```
