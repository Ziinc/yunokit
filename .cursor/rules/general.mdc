- Always refer to @DEVELOPMENT.md for development pattern and style guide. YOU MUST DO THIS.
- be as succinct as possible.
- always remove unused imports.
- Don't explain the effect your actions, only list out what you have done.
- always verify that the change has been correctly applied.
- Use the consolidated `radix-ui` package instead of individual `@radix-ui/react-*` packages.
- Import Radix UI components using destructured imports: `import { Dialog, Button } from "radix-ui"`.
- For Slot component, use `Slot.Slot` from the radix-ui package.
- When refactoring Radix UI imports, update all related type references and component usage.
