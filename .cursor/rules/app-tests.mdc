## Testing

- Tests should always be written under the `app/tests` directory. 
- Use the global setup file to perform common app-level setup.

### mocks
- always use automocks in __mocks__ folder
- never use `vi.mock()`

### assertions

- don't use `.toHaveAttribute()`, instead check the element directly
- always use `screen.findBy*` to perform element assertion
- never import `@testing-library/jest-dom` or use any related APIs or functions or modules.
- always remove jest-dom usage.
