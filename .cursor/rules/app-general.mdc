# Dev rules for working on /app

- never suggest performing an `npm install`, only recommend the packages that is used in the generated code.

## Routing
Use the [App.tsx](mdc:app/src/App.tsx) router logic to determine the correct paths for links and general navigation

## Testing

- Tests should always be written under the `app/tests` directory. 
- When working on files under `app/src/lib/**`, always ensure that there are appropriate tests written.
