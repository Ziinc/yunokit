# Dev rules for working on /app

- never suggest performing an `npm install`, only recommend the packages that is used in the generated code.
- Always use [database.types.ts](mdc:app/database.types.ts) as the supabase schema reference.

## useEffect callback
- never create a callback in a useEffect. Always create it outside of the useEffect.

## Routing
Use the [App.tsx](mdc:app/src/App.tsx) router logic to determine the correct paths for links and general navigation

## Page Layout
- always ensure that pages within the app are standardized.
- Pages with tabs should use the correct [tabs.tsx](mdc:app/src/components/ui/tabs.tsx) component instead of buttons.
- Any use of tabs should result in nested routes so that each tab has its own path.


## Testing

- Tests should always be written under the `app/tests` directory. 
- When working on files under `app/src/lib/**`, always ensure that there are appropriate tests written.
