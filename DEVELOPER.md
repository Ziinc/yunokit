Find me 5 refactoring opportunities where we can eliminate dead code and better match the style guide in `DEVELOPMENT.md`.
Focus on eliminating dead code and removing redundancies. I want clean and succinct 
and concise code, with minimal over complexity and no unecessary inline comments. Reduce verbosity where possible.
Note that there are active agents that are working on the codebase.
Focus on the ./app directory only. 
This can be in the form of tests or source code.
Do not include CSS refactoring.
Each task should be in separate files/areas to avoid merge conflicts. Avoid over-abstraction.
Give each task a detailed implementation breakdown.
